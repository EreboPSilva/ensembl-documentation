## Generating Automatic, Evidence-based Protein-coding Gene Models

Genome annotation is generated primarily through alignment of publicly available transcriptomic data to the genome. Gaps in the annotation are filled via protein-to-genome alignments of a select set of proteins. The data and techniques employed to generate gene models are outlined here.
