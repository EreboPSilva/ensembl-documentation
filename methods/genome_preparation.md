# Genome annotation

## Genome preparation

The genome preparation phase of the Ensembl gene annotation system involves loading an assembly into an Ensembl core database schema and then running a series of analyses on the loaded assembly to identify an initial set of genomic features.

The most important aspect of this phase is identifying repeat features as soft masking of the genome is used extensively later in the annotation process.
