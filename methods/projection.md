### Model Generation Through Mapping of Reference Annotations to the Genome

A whole genome alignment against either the human or Mouse GENCODE reference assembly is generated using LastZ ([Harris, R.S., 2007](https://www.bx.psu.edu/~rsharris/rsharris_phd_thesis_2007.pdf)). Syntenic regions are identified from this alignment and protein-coding annotations from the most recent released gene set is mapped to the genome through localised alignments using CESAR 2.0 ([Sharma, V.P., *et al*, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx527)).
