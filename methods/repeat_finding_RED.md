### Repeat Finding

After the genomic sequence has been loaded into a database, it is screened for sequence patterns, including repeats using Red ([Girgis, H.Z., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-015-0654-5)), dustmasker ([Morgulis, A., *et al.*, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1089/cmb.2006.13.1028)) and TRF ([Benson, G., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/27.2.573)).
