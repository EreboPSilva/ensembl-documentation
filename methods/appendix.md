## Appendix - Further information
The Ensembl gene set is generated automatically, meaning that gene models are annotated using the Ensembl gene annotation pipelines. The main focus of the pipelines is to generate a conservative set of protein-coding gene models.

Every gene model produced by the Ensembl gene annotation pipeline is supported by biological sequence evidence (see the “Supporting evidence” link on the left-hand menu of a Gene page or Transcript page); ab initio models are not included in our gene set.
