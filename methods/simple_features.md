### Low complexity features, ab initio predictions

On the softmasked genome, transcription start sites are predicted using Eponineâ€“scan ([Down, T.A., *et al*, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.216102)). Additionally, CpG islands ([Larsen, F., *et al*, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0888-7543(92)90024-m))longer than 400 bases are also predicted using the  and tRNAs are also predicted. The results of Eponine-scan, CpG[7], and tRNAscan [8] are for display purposes only; they are not used in the gene annotation process.

Genscan [9] is run across repeat-masked sequence to identify ab initio gene predictions. Genscan predictions are for display purposes only and are not used in the model generation phase.

Lastly, transport RNAs are predicted using tRNAscan-SE ([Chan, P.P., *et al*, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9173-0_1)).
