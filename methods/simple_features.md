### Low complexity features, ab initio predictions

Transcription start sites are predicted using Eponineâ€“scan [6]. CpG islands longer than 400 bases and tRNAs are also predicted. The results of Eponine-scan, CpG[7], and tRNAscan [8] are for display purposes only; they are not used in the gene annotation process.

Genscan [9] is run across repeat-masked sequence to identify ab initio gene predictions. Genscan predictions are for display purposes only and are not used in the model generation phase.
