### Low Complexity Feature Prediction

Transcription start sites are predicted using Eponineâ€“scan [6], CpG islands longer than 400 bases are predicted using CpG ([Larsen, F., *et al*, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0888-7543(92)90024-m)) and tRNAs are predicted using tRNAscan-SE [Chan, P.P., *et al*, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9173-0_1). The results of Eponine-scan, CpG, and tRNAscan are for display purposes only; they are not used in the gene annotation process.
