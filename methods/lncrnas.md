## Identifying lncRNAs

If a model fails to meet the criteria of any of the previously described categories, does not overlap a protein-coding gene, and has been constructed from transcriptomic data then it is considered as a potential lncRNA. Potential lncRNAs are additionally filtered to remove single-exon loci due to the unreliability of such models.
