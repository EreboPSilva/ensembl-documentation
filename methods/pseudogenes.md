### Identifying Pseudogenes

Models with hits to known proteins that also display abnormalities such as absence of a start codon, non-canonical splicing, unusually small intron structures (< 75bp) or excessive repeat coverage, are reclassified as pseudogenes. Single-exon models with a corresponding multi-exon copy elsewhere in the genome are classified as processed (retrotransposed) pseudogenes.
