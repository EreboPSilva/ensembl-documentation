### Identifying Immunoglobulin and T-cell Receptor genes

Translations of different IG gene segments from closely related species are downloaded from the [IMGT database](https://www.imgt.org/) ([Lefranc, M.P., *et al.*, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gku1056)) and aligned to the genome using GenBlast. For GenBlast, a cut-off of 80% coverage, 70% identity, and an e-value threshold of e-1 is applied, with the exon repair option enabled. The top 10 transcript models generated by GenBlast for each protein meeting these cut-offs are retained.
